Travelling merchants are looking for an escort to the nearby city of Adenaburg.
You go outside the city gates and meet the merchants you're supposed to escort. There's a middle aged man and woman along with a young boy sitting on top of a covered wagon loaded with assorted crates and barrels of different sizes. They wave at you so you approach them. They introduce themselves as the Bennetts and are travelling to Adenaburg with a delivery of fresh meat and vegetables. They explain that usually they would travel by themselves but lately there's been rumors of people going missing in the Jura forest in between here and Adenaburg. They explain that there is an alternate route through the mountains but it gets very steep and is quite dangerous. They leave the decision up to you, the experienced adventurer.//N//Do you take them on the dangerous mountain path?->3//Or do you ignore the rumors and go through the Jura forest?->4
